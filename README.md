# University of Waterloo - Humans vs Zombies

## About

New UW HvZ website, built on Django. Front-end uses custom styling via Sass/SCSS in the `static/` folder.

To start a local server do the following:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tiffanynwyeung/uwhvz.git
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python manage.py migrate

```

To make a migration after changing models, etc., use `python manage.py makemigrations app`.

## Technical Notes

### Models

A person has an account created for them in person by a mod. In this case, they
are AUTO ADDED to the current game (because there's no reason to create an 
account otherwise).

What does this really mean?? It means we're in a SIGNUP period. Games have
SIGNUP periods where:
- People who do not have an account already can signup in person
- People who DO have an account can simply go to the website and click "sign up"

Constraints:
1. Every user has at LEAST one player
2. Every player is mapped one to one to a game
3. From 1 and 2: every user has been in at least one game
4. Every player is owned by a user
5. At any given point at MOST a SINGLE game is visible to the user

Game states: SIGNUP -> RUNNING -> FINISHED
