      <p>While every weeklong game is made unique by the moderator team, there are a few constants that new players can expect to encounter.</p>

            <p>Sign-ups for the weeklong are held a week before the game begins. Once the game starts, players may message a mod to join, however there is no guarantee the mods will approve a late join for the sake of fairness. Signup booths are set up around campus, with information posted to the Official UW HvZ Social Media Accounts. Players may also sign up directly on the website.</p>

          <p>When signing up to play, players are able to select if they would like to be considered to start the game as an Original Zombie (OZ). The number of OZs is determined by the moderator team, based on the total number of anticipated players. Players who do not request to be considered for OZ are guaranteed to be human at game start.</p></div>

      <p>The Sunday night before the weeklong begins, the moderator team will host a series of short mini-missions (~20-30min) located in a single building. New players are highly recommended to attend – this is a great chance to meet other players, get comfortable with your blasters/socks, and try mission designs that may or may not be included in the following week.</p></div>

      <p>Humans and zombie players will traditionally set up Facebook messenger chats to communicate to their teams during the weeklong. These chats are the primary way of socializing with other players and organizing around supply drops/mini-missions. If you’re not a part of one on Monday, please either message someone you know if playing, or post on the UW HvZ Facebook page!</p>

    <p>NOTE: There should be at least one moderator added to each HvZ-related chat, to answer questions about rules and ensure everyone is being treated fairly.</p>

      <p>At (or around) 12:15am of the Monday of the weeklong, a supply drop is traditionally held. This is the first event, and generally sees large turnout by human players. It’s also a chance to discover who some of the OZs are, and to be added into your team’s chat for the weeklong.</p>

      <p>Points can be earned by stunning a zombie or cashing in a supply code obtained from a supply drop. If a human doesn't have at least 5 points by Friday afternoon, they become a zombie.

These sessions are neither mod-run nor mandatory events, but highly recommended to meet other players and ensure that your team has enough people who know what to expect in the main mission.</p>

      <p>​Coming out to weeklong events and being active in the team chats is a great way for people to recognize you and want to play with you more. Don’t be shy to introduce yourself, especially to older players - many of them love seeing new players join the game, and would love to squad up with you.

      <p>If the player that tagged you hasn’t already, ask them to add you to the zombie Facebook chat. You can start playing zombie as soon as your stun timer is finished, you do not need to wait for the player who tagged you to report it. We highly recommend giving the zombie side a try. If anything, it helps to learn how zombies play and think - which will help you survive as a human next time!</p>

      <p>That's wonderful to hear! But please understand that moderators are very busy running the game during weeklong. Moderators will usually host a Post-Mortem a few weeks after weeklong. This is a designated time for players (both human and zombie) to share their thoughts on the weeklong. What did you like? What would you like to see in the future? These meetings are documented for future moderators to reflect upon in their weeklong design.</p>
