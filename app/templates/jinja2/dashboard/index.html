    <p>The game will begin on Monday, March 9th @ 12:00 AM, and runs 24 hours a day from the beginning of Monday until the end of final mission on Friday March 13th. If you have any friends who have never played before and would like to join, please send them to one of our signup booths before Friday, March 6th at 5 PM. Alternatively, they can contact us at uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com via email.</p>
    <p>At 7:00 PM on Sunday, March 8th in STC, we will be hosting series of short practice missions and minigames in preparation for the weeklong game. This is a great opportunity to test out your gear, introduce yourself to the rules, and meet other players before the real game begins. Please bring your own bandana and socks/blasters.</p>
    <p>At 11:00 PM on Sunday, March 8th, you will receive an email indicating whether you are beginning the game as a HUMAN or a ZOMBIE. This email will also include information relevant for the entire weeklong, so make sure you’re checking your inbox!</p>
    <p>Throughout the week, the moderator team will be communicating to you primarily through email. Each night, an email will be sent out including the schedule and events for the next day. Main Mission details will be sent out in a separate email one hour before the Main Mission begins - there will be one occurring most nights of the week. Our website (right here!) will also display announcements and mission details for the day.</p>
    <p>Additional important information will also be sent over twitter through @HVZAlertSystem, which can conveniently be found right here! If you need to rent a blaster from the Humans vs Zombie Society for use in the weeklong, you can email us at uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com for more information.</p>
