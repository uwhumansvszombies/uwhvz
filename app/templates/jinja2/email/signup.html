<p>A couple new mechanics for Humans have been introduced including <strong>FACTIONS</strong>. Factions are human teams that give special perks to their members, missions will help or hinder your faction. Every human player must now wear two bandanas on the same arm. The moderators will provide you a bandana of your faction’s colour when you sign up for a faction. <strong>Factions are Human Team Only.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/hDoz6tf"><strong>Here is a list of factions.</strong></a></p>
<p>You may sign up for a faction by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going back to a sign up booth</li>
<li>Our Practice Mission on Sunday</li>
<li>Or by asking a Moderator during the weeklong game (This includes, mini-mission, @ the shop, supply drops)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You don’t need to choose a faction right away or at all.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to rent a blaster from the Humans vs Zombie Society, you can email us at uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com for more information.</p>
